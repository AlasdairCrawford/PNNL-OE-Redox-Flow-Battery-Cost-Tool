PNNL-OE-Redox-Flow-Battery-Cost-Tool
====================================

An interactive tool has been developed to estimate the capital cost for PNNL all vanadium Gen 1, Gen2 &amp; iron-vanadium chemistires, and adapted for organic electrolyte redox flow batteries. The tool allows determination of the most cost-effective chemistries and the optimum operating conditions for power or energy intensive applications, providing a strategy for a redox flow battery management system (BMS). This tool was developed with funding from The U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability/Energy Storage Program, under the leadership of Dr. Imre Gyuk.
